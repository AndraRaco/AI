## I. A* Algorithm
### 1. The Problem with Cubes
  We are given M cubes that are put in N stacks. We have the initial configuration and have to apply the A* algorithm to reach the Goal configuration. We can move only the cubes that are placed on top.

### 2. 8-puzzle
  8-Puzzle is a popular puzzle that consists of N tiles where N can be 8, 15, 24 and so on. In our example N = 8. The puzzle is divided into sqrt(N+1) rows and sqrt(N+1) columns. The puzzle can be solved by moving the tiles one by one in the single empty space and thus achieving the Goal configuration.

### 3. The Missionaries and Cannibals Problem
  In the missionaries and cannibals problem, N missionaries and N cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most M people, under the constraint that, for both banks, if there are missionaries present on the bank, they cannot be outnumbered by cannibals (if they were, the cannibals would eat the missionaries). The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board.
