## I. A* algorithm
### 1. The problem with cubes
  We are given M cubes that are put in N stacks. We have the initial configuration and have to apply the A* algorithm to reach the Goal configuration. We can move only the cubes that are placed on top.

### 2. 8-puzzle
  8-Puzzle is a popular puzzle that consists of N tiles where N can be 8, 15, 24 and so on. In our example N = 8. The puzzle is divided into sqrt(N+1) rows and sqrt(N+1) columns. The puzzle can be solved by moving the tiles one by one in the single empty space and thus achieving the Goal configuration.
