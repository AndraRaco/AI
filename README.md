  8-Puzzle is a popular puzzle that consists of N tiles where N can be 8, 15, 24 and so on. In our example N = 8. The puzzle is divided into sqrt(N+1) rows and sqrt(N+1) columns. The puzzle can be solved by moving the tiles one by one in the single empty space and thus achieving the Goal configuration.
